# Fitness Tracker

## Description

In this assignment assignment I created a web app that allows a user to tracker their expenses. This is done by using a service worker which allows us to cache front end files on the users device, so that they can revisit the app offline and still be able to use it. I also used IndexDB which allows us to store the users expenses on their device until they come back online. This way the data is not lost while the user is offline.
